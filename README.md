**Description:**
This is my *first* real project written in html/css/js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend when I was 14. The basic idea is that two or more people in the same "channel" or chatroom can send each other messages by typing. Text is sent after space is entered so everyone get's a more "live" feed of what's going on. The message then slowly dissapears via the chatbox moving left until it's hidden from all screens. The chatbox then comes back with no text to display. A lot of the code here is really messy and I haven't dabbled with it in a while, but feel free to fix any of the bugs-- I'm sure there are many. That being said, as I type this, both the server and the client are functional and can be used to transmit messages, so feel free to give it a try.

**Installation:**
To fire up the server run "node index.js" in the master directory(make sure you have node installed). Then just go to "localhost:8000" in your web browser, and you should be greeted weith an entrance screen. Other people on your network can also join by entering "[your local ip adress]:8000" in their web browsers.
